"For the cons, the ad version is kind of lame and I don't get why Amazon do it. Being so light weight means that it's all plastic so don't drop your Fire, and if is for children use buy a cinder block cover. Sound is pretty good in my opinion with Dolby Atmos. Cameras are definitely lacking not a good tablet for taking pictures at all, it serves the purpose of taking pictures, just that. With no fast charging (at least HD version) charging is tortous. And the biggest con ever, Does not work with Google. So no Playstore, Gmail, photos, Chrome, Calendar, etc... Prepare for life without Google. The Amazon App store is very limited on app variety so that is a drag, a huge drag.","False","True","0.9131966","2.3533058"

"it was so tight it felt like it was choking me till I pulled on it a few times to loosen it. The torso is so short it goes down to JUST my waistline, yet is so wide at the bottom I could fit 2 of me in here. Honestly I hate it, I�ve never had a hoodie fit so horribly. Way too small in some places, way too big in another.","False","False","0.39630687","-0.4208771"

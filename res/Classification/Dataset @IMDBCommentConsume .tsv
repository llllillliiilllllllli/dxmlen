After 3 and half seasons of the same thing happening over and over, of characters acting irrationally against their own best interests, of June's very sophisticated facial expressions, of one cliff-hanger per episode to keep your curiosity up through the feet-dragging and fake depth... it's probably time to acknowledge that this lemon has already been squeezed dry and move on.	0
The Handmaid's Tale is one of the most infuriating, depressing, and most difficult to watch shows I've ever seen. You keep waiting for things to turn into June's favor or all the terrible people in the show to get what they have coming to them but it just never happens. It just keeps getting more and more depressing and hopeless!	0
The first two seasons were indisputably iconic. The rest is Savior Complex on steroids. After season two, I have a theory that each episode would only last about 10 minutes if all of the long silent closeups of June's face were removed.	0
My exact thought echoed here by several reviewers so apparently I am not alone! Just got tired of her face's weird projection that comes off like she is about to transform into an alien or monster.	0
Its endless parade of misery with no hope in sight, I cant take this anymore and its always same story line. In the end we can see close ups of Elizabeth Moss huge eyeballs and see how she get kick and beaten.	0

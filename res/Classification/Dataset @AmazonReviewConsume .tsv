I want to send back the product and get my money returned.	0
Highly recommend this for those who are looking for comfort, clarity with reasonable price.	1
This sweater in summer gets TOO hot during the say. I can't stand it.	0
Although if you intend to use this for the gym or running etc be warned that it absorbs water and can get heavy, as stated above it gets warm so you WILL sweat.	0
The offer is fairly alright. I think its design could be better. But for this prices, cannot argue too much. Anyway, I find it useful in some cases, but some other cases not.	1
It was so tight it felt like it was choking me till I pulled on it a few times to loosen it. The torso is so short it goes down to JUST my waistline, yet is so wide at the bottom I could fit 2 of me in here. Honestly I hate it, I’ve never had a hoodie fit so horribly. Way too small in some places, way too big in another.	0

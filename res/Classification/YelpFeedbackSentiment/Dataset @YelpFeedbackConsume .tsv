We were grossed out by the melted ice-cream at the end. The rest were great but I love dessert so I would rate it 5 out of 10.	0
On a positive note, our server was very attentive. But then the main meal come out very late. We have to wait for thirteen minutes.	0
The burgers are terrific. Cannot complain 'cause cheese makes me happy. Me and my friends order half of the set.	1
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.	1
I wonder if Yelp menu have ever changed. They repeatly serve the same foods and drinks.	0

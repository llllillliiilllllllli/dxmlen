Complex data transmission environments are often characterized by a large number of data requester profiles, a large number of data request types, and/or a large number of data request conditions. Because dynamic data transmission often requires taking into account the data requester profiles, the data request types, and/or data request conditions when generating data request responses, the complexity of the noted data transmission environments presents significant challenges for efficiently and reliably generating data request responses under reasonable time constraints. This challenge is compounded as the number of data requester profiles, the data request types, and/or data request conditions increases. In some embodiments, the increase in the number of data requester profiles, the data request types, and/or data request conditions requires storing large amounts of configuration data often in a distributed manner, a feature that further undermines the efficiency and reliability of performing scalable dynamic data transmission in complex data transmission environments.</div>

Accordingly, in some embodiments, the structured data retrieval service may be configured to have a static logic that is configured to process structured data requests in a uniform manner irrespective of general properties of structured data requests as specified by structured requester headers and/or irrespective of extension requests described by structured data extensions. This in turn enables a data server computing entity to limit the portions of the data exchange logic of the data server computing entity that need to be modified to enable dynamic data exchange in a scalable fashion.</div>

Because of their greater levels of comprehensiveness resulting from their more intelligent generation, providing dynamically-generated structured data responses is likely to reduce the overall number of structured data requests that are transmitted by client computing entities to data server computing entities, as the client computing entities are likely to receive their target information fields in a fewer number of structured data responses and via a fewer number of structured data requests. This in turn both reduces the operational cost of maintaining data server computing entities and reduces network transmissions across client-server networks connecting data server computing entities and client computing entities by reducing the number of network calls from client computing entities to data server computing entities across the noted client-server networks. Accordingly, by providing dynamically-generated structured data responses to client computing entities, various embodiments of the present invention improve both operational efficiency of data server computing entities and network efficiency of client-server networks connecting data server computing entities and client computing entities.</div>

The structured data request may include: (i) a structured request header that describes one or more general metadata fields associated with the structured data request, such as at least one of a requester identifier (e.g., an identifier of the trading partner) associated with the structured data request, a request type identifier (e.g., a request type identifier describing that the structured data request is an electronic data interchange (EDI) 276 claim status request), a request time identifier (e.g., a request time identifier describing a generation time of the structured data request, a request time identifier describing a transmission time of the structured data request by a client computing entity, a request time identifier describing a receipt time of the structured data request by a data server computing entity, and/or the like); (ii) a structured request payload that describes a predefined transactional inquiry (e.g., a standardized transactional request, such as an EDI request including an EDI 276 claim status request) associated with the structured data request; and (iii) a structured request extension that may describe one or more extension request fields associated with the structured response field. In some embodiments, the predefined transactional inquiry specified by the structured request payload of the structured data request may be used to generate the predefined transactional response in the structured data response that is generated in response to the structured data request. In some embodiments, at least one of the one or more general metadata fields associated with the structured data request described by the structured request header or the one or more extension request fields described by the structured request extension may be used to generate a structured response extension of the structured data response that is generated in response to the structured data request.

An example of a standardized transactional inquiry/response formatting scheme is an EDI transactional inquiry/response formatting scheme, and examples of predefined transactional inquiries that may be generated using the EDI transactional inquiry/response formatting scheme include an EDI 276 predefined transactional inquiry, aspects of which are described in United Healthcare, Standard Companion Guide (Companion Guide Version Number 4.0, published Nov. 1, 2020), available online at https://www.uhcprovider.com/content/dam/provider/docs/public/resources/edi/EDI-276-277-Companion-Guide-005010X212.pdf. In some embodiments, the predefined transactional inquiry is an EDI inquiry. In some of the noted embodiments, the EDI inquiry is an EDI 276 inquiry. In some embodiments, an identifier (e.g., a numeric identifier) of a request type of the predefined transactional inquiry (e.g., as defined by the corresponding transactional inquiry/response formatting scheme and/or as defined by a data server computing entity) is provided as part of the general metadata fields described by the structured request header of the structured data request to which the structured request payload belongs (e.g., as the request type identifier of the structured request header of the structured data request to which the structured request payload belongs). While various embodiments of the present invention are described with reference to an exemplary embodiment in which a structured data request describes one predefined transactional inquiry only, a person of ordinary skill in the relevant technology will recognize that a structured request payload may in some embodiments describe two or more predefined transactional inquiries without departing from the spirit of the present invention.</div>

The structured request extension may enable a client computing entity to explicitly request data beyond the data provided in response to a predefined transactional inquiry described by the structured request payload of the structured data request. Importantly, however, the structured request extension may in some embodiments describe no extension requests fields (i.e., “is empty”), in order to enable the client computing entity to make requests for predefined transactional responses via predefined transactional inquiries without explicitly specifying extension request fields. In some embodiments, even when the structured request extension of a structured data response is empty such that no extension requests fields are specified by the structured request extension, a structured response extension of a structured data response generated in response to the structured data response may include extension response fields (e.g., may be “non-empty”). This may be because, in at least some embodiments, the extension response fields described by a structured response extension of a structured data response may include static extension response fields determined based on the one or more extension request fields described by a structured request extension of a corresponding structured data request as well as dynamic extension response fields determined based on a subset of the general metadata fields described by the structured request header of the corresponding structured data request. In some embodiments, when a structured data request (e.g., the structured request payload of the structured data request) relates to two or more claim data entities (e.g., relates to two or more health insurance claims), the structured response extension of the structured data response corresponding to the structured data request describes/designates, for each of the two more claim data entities, a set of fields of the structured response extension that relate to the claim data entity.</div>

A structured response payload may describe a contiguous segment of a structured data response that describes a predefined transactional response associated with the structured data response, where the predefined transactional response is a transactional response that is formatted in accordance with a transactional inquiry/response formatting scheme such as a standardized transactional inquiry/response formatting scheme. An example of a standardized transactional inquiry/response formatting scheme is an EDI transactional inquiry/response formatting scheme, and examples of predefined transactional inquiries that may be generated using the EDI transactional inquiry/response formatting scheme include an EDI 277 predefined transactional response, aspects of which are described in United Healthcare, Standard Companion Guide (Companion Guide Version Number 4.0, published Nov. 1, 2020), available online at https://www.uhcprovider.com/content/dam/provider/docs/public/resources/edi/EDI-276-277-Companion-Guide-005010X212.pdf. In some embodiments, the predefined transactional response is an EDI response. In some of the noted embodiments, the EDI response is an EDI 277 claim status response. In some embodiments, an identifier (e.g., a numeric identifier) of a response type of the predefined transactional response (e.g., as defined by the corresponding transactional inquiry/response formatting scheme and/or as defined by the data server computing entity) is provided as part of general metadata fields described by a structured response payload of the structured data response to which the structured response payload belongs (e.g., as the response type identifier of the structured response header of the structured data response to which the structured response payload belongs). While various embodiments of the present invention are described with reference to an exemplary embodiment in which a structured data request describes one predefined transactional inquiry only, a person of ordinary skill in the relevant technology will recognize that a structured request payload may in some embodiments describe two or more predefined transactional inquiries without departing from the spirit of the present invention. In some of those embodiments, when the structured request payload of a structured data request describes two or more predefined transactional inquiries, the structured response payload of a structured data response that is generated in response to the structured data request describes two or more predefined transactional responses (e.g., a predefined transactional response corresponding to each of the two or more predefined transactional inquiries).</div>

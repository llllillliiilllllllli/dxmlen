4.0 out of 5 stars A good deal for the price
Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2022
Style: Speaker SystemVerified Purchase
The radio feature and remote work great. We had a little trouble with the Blue Tooth connection but once we figured out the steps it was easy. The speaker is very light but from the add it did look like it came with a mike. We'd buy it again!

4.0 out of 5 stars Good value!
Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2022
Style: Speaker SystemVerified Purchase
I bought this speaker for good value and some fun. I knew I was not going to get high-fidelity. I expected the lows and highs were going to be weak or non-existent, and I was not disappointed because I got what I paid for. It is lightweight for its size and thus probably had a puny magnet. I bought it anyways because I just needed something for camping and karaoke. I also bought the Pyle wireless mic kit and it worked perfectly with this speaker, except the echoing was not adjustable on the speaker or mic. Overall, I give it 3.5 stars but had to round it up to 4.

I am happy with my portable amplifier. I'm so glad they put a switch on , amp for the light. I like the light but don't want them on all the time. Easy to move a round. It's a good buy. Johnny üôÇ.

5.0 out of 5 stars Sounds great for karaoke
Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2022
Style: Speaker SystemVerified Purchase
I'm using it for the PA system to sing karaoke. Built-in Bluetooth mode let's me hook up any Bluetooth device and use YouTube or other song choice apps to sing songs. The lights just go through a light set system change, it has an on an off switch.. It's loud and has enough bass to sing, but bass sounds ok. There is a remote and you can use the EQ button for more bass has 4 sound options in EQ settings. If your looking for something that has Maga bass sound then this item is not for you. Other than that its perfect for me and I'm enjoying it very much.
